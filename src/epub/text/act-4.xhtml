									<br/>
									<span>Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Quicken’d with youthful spleen and war-like rage,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beat down Alençon, Orleans, Burgundy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And interchanging blows I quickly shed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bespoke him thus; “Contaminated, base</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father’s care,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now thou art seal’d the son of chivalry?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The help of one stands me in little stead.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, too much folly is it, well I wot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To hazard all our lives in one small boat!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If I to-day die not with Frenchmen’s rage,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By me they nothing gain an if I stay;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Tis but the shortening of my life one day:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In thee thy mother dies, our household’s name,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My death’s revenge, thy youth, and England’s fame:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All these and more we hazard by thy stay;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.</span>
