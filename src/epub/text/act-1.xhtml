									<br/>
									<span>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck’d out of hedges</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More than three hours the fight continued;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The French exclaim’d, the devil was in arms;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And rush’d into the bowels of the battle.</span>

									<br/>

									<span>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin’s grace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</span>
